- **API**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, MongoDB, Mongoose
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Bootstrap
- **Deployment**: Vercel for the frontend, Docker for containerization

## Setup Instructions

### API Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-directory>/logistics-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env` file in the `logistics-api` directory and add the following environment variables:**

    ```env
    PORT=8080
    DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/logistics-api
    ```

4. **Run the API server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The API server should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the `logistics-frontend` directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ../logistics-frontend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Create a `.env.local` file in the `logistics-frontend` directory and add the following environment variable:**

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
    ```

4. **Run the frontend application:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment Instructions

### Deploying Backend

You can deploy the backend & frontend to any cloud service provider or use Docker for containerization.

1. **Navigate to the root directory:**

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

2. **Build and run the Docker container for both frontend and backend:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

3. **To Build and run the Docker container for the backend alone:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t logistics-backend .
    docker run -p 8080:8080 logistics-backend
    ```

    Ensure your MongoDB instance is accessible from the deployed backend.

### Deploying Frontend

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**

    ```bash
    npm install -g vercel
    ```

2. **Login to Vercel:**

    ```bash
    vercel login
    ```

3. **Deploy the frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    vercel
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables on Vercel:**

    Go to your projectâ€™s dashboard on Vercel, navigate to the "Settings" tab, and add your environment variables, such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.

By following these instructions, you should be able to set up and deploy your Supply Chain Tracking System successfully.
